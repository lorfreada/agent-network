# What is Agent Network?

Agent network is a new framework as a python sdk which at the time of writing this considers all the benefits and drawbacks of current agent framework and to create something that is:

1. Safety built in, yet customizable
2. Intuitive to the developer
3. Effective
4. Production ready
5. Flexible and customizable

You should essentially be able to have discrete components within an Agentic System which have an input and output that be tested, evaluated and easily finetuned from this data:

1. The agency that can take in agents
2. Agents themselves
3. Tools the agents can use

## Why design a new framework?

From the current agent frameworks I have observed through research trial/testing. They are either not intuitive or they are pinned or somewhat pinned to a certain technology or brand. I would like to design something that can be flexible enough so that you can plug in whatever tech you want into it, whether that tech is alive now or in the future.
